# Rules for contributing 👨🏻‍💻

### ✅
* Keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
* Make sure there is no merge conflict
* Add fun and wicked things. This is not serious project, add easter eggs and ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ stuff. 🐮

### ❌
* DONT SPAM! If you are able to fix small error or improve some small thing, thats ok, but don't try to add something just to add (eg. just a console.log)
* Don't use prettier/auto indent/auto format we don't want merge conflicts, right?
* Use simple things, don't add some huge library!

# Ideas 🧠
* Add more wicked and silly stuff (animations, colors, easter eggs)
* Add layout to index.js
* Style the index.html
* Update Readme.md
* Check issues for more things to do
* Spelling and grammar


## please ⭐ the project, and lets 🚀 it together!
